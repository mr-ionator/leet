# Intuition

# need to run nested loops to check against each other
# Approach

# ->Defining a result array
# ->looping the nums array
# ->creating a nested loop for checking against one value
# ->increase count by 1 whenever an element less than is caught.
# ->append to the array and return

class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count = 0
            for j in range(0,len(nums)):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    count = count + 1
            result.append(count)
        return result
